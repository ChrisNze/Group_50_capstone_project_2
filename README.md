# Experience learning Frontend (HTL, CSS, TailwindCss, JS) so far in SideHustle Internship

SideHustle internship is a dream come through for aspiring young developers like us. We have learnt a lot in HTML, CSS and TailwindCss ever since the internship started. Before now, we weren't able to build a User Interface using HTML and CSS but gradually, we are learning it.

SideHustle Frontend (HTML, CSS, Tailwindcss, JS) Mentor is really doing a good job in making sure that we are well equipped in it. Every week, we are given a well explained tutorial videos to aid us in our learning, after which we take an online quiz to ensure that we grab all that were thought for that week. This project is the Second project we are doing and more are yet to come.

We say a very thank you to SideHustle for this great opportunity.
